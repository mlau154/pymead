Linear-Strength Vortex Panel Method
===================================

The linear-strength vortex panel method built-in to *pymead* is based on Katz & Plotkin [1]. More details about
the theory can be found in the reference, and the API documentation and source code can be found at
:doc:`../_autosummary/pymead.analysis.single_element_inviscid.single_element_inviscid`. Example usages for both the
GUI and API are shown below.

.. note::

    Because this analysis method uses a just-in-time compiler, it will run slowly the first time (though the execution
    time should still be around a few seconds or faster). Subsequent runs should execute significantly faster.

        :sync: api

        To analyze an airfoil using the inviscid panel method, only the airfoil coordinates and the angle of attack
        in degrees are required as inputs. Given an airfoil coordinate file called "airfoil_coords.txt" which
        has the airfoil coordinates in the Selig format (counter-clockwise starting from the upper side of the trailing
        edge) and a single header row with the airfoil name, the airfoil can be analyzed as follows:

        .. code-block:: python

            import numpy as np
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            from pymead.analysis.single_element_inviscid import single_element_inviscid

            coords = np.loadtxt("airfoil_coords.txt", skiprows=1)
            co, cp, cl = single_element_inviscid(coords, alpha=5.0)
            print(f"Lift coefficient = {cl}")
            x = co[:, 0]
            y = co[:, 1]
            plt.plot(x, cp)
            plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
            plt.xlabel(r"$x/c$")
            plt.ylabel(r"$C_p$")
            plt.show()


.. _xfoil:

XFOIL
=====

XFOIL is a vortex panel method coupled with a boundary-layer solver. More information about XFOIL can
be found at the `XFOIL home page <https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/>`_.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: GUI
        :sync: gui

        An XFOIL analysis can be setup and run by navigating in the toolbar to
        **Analysis** |rarrow| **Single-Airfoil** |rarrow| **Viscous**. Selecting this menu option brings up a dialog
        with a number of options. Once the options are configured as desired, press **OK** to run XFOIL. A detailed
        description of the various configuration options is given below.

        .. list-table::
           :widths: 20 80
           :header-rows: 1
           :class: max-width-table

           * - Option
             - Description
           * - Viscosity On?
             - Whether to include the boundary-layer solver in the XFOIL analysis. A separate command is run in XFOIL
               when this option is selected.
           * - Specify Reynolds Number?
             - Whether to directly specify the Reynolds number directly rather than indirectly through Mach number,
               length scale, etc. Selecting this option will disable the option to modify several of the atmospheric
               variables below.
           * - Mach Number
             - The ratio of velocity to speed of sound for the flow. Used along with the temperature, gas constant,
               and specific heat ratio
               to determine the freestream velocity if "Specify Reynolds Number?" is not checked. Also used
               within XFOIL to calculate a compressibility correction to make the analysis more accurate at higher
               Mach numbers. Note that, as the XFOIL documentation mentions, the use of any freestream Mach number where
               supersonic flow over the airfoil occurs will incur severe accuracy penalties.
           * - Specify Flow Variables
             - A combination of two thermodynamic state variables to use to determine the third out of pressure,
               temperature, and density using the ideal gas law.
           * - Pressure (Pa)
             - The static thermodynamic pressure of the airfoil environment in Pascals. Ignored if "Specify Reynolds
               Number?" is checked.
           * - Temperature (K)
             - The static thermodynamic temperature of the airfoil environment in Kelvin. Ignored if "Specify Reynolds
               Number?" is checked.
           * - Density (kg/m^3)
             - The density of the airfoil environment in kilograms per cubic meter. Ignored if "Specify Reynolds
               Number?" is checked.
           * - Specific Heat Ratio
             - The ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to specific heat at constant volume. Ignored if
               "Specify Reynolds Number?" is checked.
           * - Length Scale (m)
             - The length scale, in meters, used to determine the Reynolds number. Ignored if "Specify Reynolds Number?"
               is checked.
           * - Gas Constant (J/(kg*K))
             - The specific gas constant in Joules per kilogram Kelvin. Ignored if "Specify Reynolds Number?" is
               checked.
           * - Prescribe Î±/Cl/CLI
             - Whether to prescribe angle of attack, viscous lift coefficient, or inviscid lift coefficient.
               If the lift coefficient is prescribed, XFOIL uses the linear lift-curve slope to compute the angle of
               attack required to achieve the prescribed lift coefficient.
           * - Angle of Attack (deg)
             - The angle of attack of the airfoil in degrees. The angle of attack is relative to the angle of the
               input geometry as shown in the geometry canvas, so the total angle of attack analyzed is the sum of
               the two angles of attack.
           * - Viscous Cl
             - Viscous lift coefficient.
           * - Inviscid Cl
             - Inviscid lift coefficient.
           * - Transition x/c (upper)
             - Chord-normalized x-location along the upper surface where transition is forced. Transition can naturally
               occur upstream of the specified location, but it will never occur downstream. If a value of 1.0
               is specified, free transition is allowed.
           * - Transition x/c (lower)
             - Chord-normalized x-location along the lower surface where transition is forced.
           * - Turbulence (NCrit)
             - Transition amplification factor. A value of 9.0 is used for an average wind tunnel. See the
               `XFOIL documentation page <https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/xfoil_doc.txt>`_ for details
               about this variable and typical values for other scenarios.
           * - Maximum Iterations
             - The number of iterations allowed during viscous analysis. Ignored if "Viscosity On?" is not checked.
           * - Timeout (sec)
             - The amount of time allotted to an XFOIL analysis. The XFOIL process will be automatically terminated
               after this amount of time regardless of whether the analysis has completed.
           * - Airfoil to Analyze
             - This is the name of an airfoil found in the "Airfoils" container of the parameter tree; default names
               are "Airfoil-1", "Airfoil-2", etc. See the :ref:`airfoils` section to learn about airfoil creation.
           * - Analysis Base Directory
             - This is the directory where a new sub-directory named using the next field ("Airfoil Name") will
               be created to store the analysis files.
           * - Airfoil Name
             - Separate from the "Airfoil to Analyze" option, this is the name given to the analysis sub-directory
               and to several of the files used for analysis.

.. _mses-suite:

MSES Suite
==========

Because
`MSES <https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/mses-software-high-lift-multielement-airfoil>`_
is a full suite of tools/executables rather than a single primary executable like XFOIL, the
field entry descriptions will be split up into several categories that correspond with the vertical tabs in the
MSES analysis dialog. These are MSET (grid generation), MSES (flow analysis), MPLOT (post-processing), and
MPOLAR (polar analysis). Additional information about each of these programs can be found in the
`MSES user guide <https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/mses/mses.pdf>`_.

MSET
----

MSET is built-in grid generation tool within the MSES suite. Note that the MSET tool automatically re-meshes
the airfoil surfaces according to the set of input parameters.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: GUI
        :sync: gui

        The MSET settings can be accessed from the GUI by navigating in the toolbar to
        **Analysis** |rarrow| **Multi-Element Airfoil**. Descriptions of the various parameters are given below.
        More details on these parameters can be found in the
        `MSES user guide <https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/mses/mses.pdf>`_ in the "MSET" section.

        .. list-table::
           :widths: 20 80
           :header-rows: 1
           :class: max-width-table

           * - Option
             - Description
           * - MEA
             - The name of the multi-element airfoil to be analyzed that matches a name under the
               "Multi-Element Airfoils" sub-container of the parameter tree. Note that even for single-airfoil
               analysis in MSES, a multi-element airfoil must be created. See :ref:`multi-element-airfoils` for
               more information about how to create these objects.
           * - Grid Bounds
             - These four values represent the chord-normalized locations of the four sides of the pseudo-rectangular
               grid boundary. The "Left" and "Right" fields represent the :math:`x/c`-locations of the vertical
               inlet and outlet lines, respectively. The "Bottom" and "Top" fields represent the
               :math:`y/c`-locations of the "floor" and "ceiling" of the flow volume, respectively. Note that all
               MSES analyses automatically normalize the airfoil coordinates by the chord length of the first airfoil
               in the multi-element airfoil system.
           * - Airfoil Side Points
             - The number of grid points allocated to each airfoil side when re-meshing the airfoil surfaces.
           * - Side Points Exponent
             - If this value is 1.0, each airfoil element is allocated a number of grid points proportional to its
               chord. If this value is 0.0, each airfoil receives the same number of grid points.
           * - Inlet Points Left
             - Number of streamwise cells upstream of the leftmost airfoil stagnation point.
           * - Outlet Points Right
             - Number of streamwise cells downstream of the rightmost airfoil stagnation point.
           * - Number Top Streamlines
             - Number of stream-normal cells above the uppermost airfoil surface.
           * - Number Bottom Streamlines
             - Number of stream-normal cells below the lowermost airfoil surface.
           * - Max Streamlines Between
             - Maximum number of stream-normal cells between any two airfoil elements.
           * - Elliptic Parameter
             - None
           * - Stag. Pt. Aspect Ratio
             - Aspect ratio of the cells at the stagnation points.
           * - X-Spacing Parameter
             - From the `MSES user guide <https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/mses/mses.pdf>`_:
               "...how much the quasi-normal grid lines spread out away from the airfoil.
               A larger value (0.8 ... 1.0) tends to make the grid more orthogonal (which is good), but may cause
               excessive bunching of the quasi-normal grid lines in high-lift cases (which is bad). Transonic flows
               are best run with a nearly-orthogonal grid, since grid shearing increases the amount of dissipation
               needed for stability."
           * - Streamline Gen. Alpha
             - Angle of attack in degrees used to generate the initial set of streamlines.
           * - MSET Timeout
             - This is the maximum amount of time for allotted grid generation, used to prevent hanging grid-generation
               processes from permanently freezing *pymead*.
           * - dsLE/dsAvg
             - Leading edge spacing ratio. Smaller values (closer to 0) refine the surface grid near the leading edge.
           * - dsTE/dsAvg
             - Trailing edge spacing ratio. Smaller values (closer to 0) refine the surface grid near the trailing edge.
           * - Curvature Exponent
             - Large values of this number (> 1) correspond to very fine meshing in areas of high curvature,
               while small values of this number (close to 0) correspond to nearly uniform arc length between
               airfoil surface points.
           * - U_s_smax_min
             - Arc length fraction of the starting position of the upper surface refinement.
           * - U_s_smax_max
             - Arc length fraction of the ending position of the upper surface refinement.
           * - L_s_smax_min
             - Arc length fraction of the starting position of the lower surface refinement.
           * - L_s_smax_max
             - Arc length fraction of the ending position of the lower surface refinement.
           * - U Local/Max. Density Ratio
             - Upper side spacing refinement. Higher values increase the refinement in the region specified
               by "U_s_smax_min" and "U_s_smax_max." A value of 0.0 indicates no refinement.
           * - L Local/Max. Density Ratio
             - Lower side spacing refinement. Higher values increase the refinement in the region specified
               by "L_s_smax_min" and "L_s_smax_max." A value of 0.0 indicates no refinement.
           * - Analysis Directory
             - This is the directory where a new sub-directory named using the next field
               ("Airfoil Coord. Filename") will be created to store the analysis files.
           * - Airfoil Coord. Filename
             - This is the name given to the analysis sub-directory and to several of the files used for analysis.
           * - Save As
             - Save all the information in every tab of this dialog to a `.json` settings file.
           * - Load
             - Loading MSES settings from a `.json` settings file (saved using the above button).
           * - Use downsampling?
             - Whether to downsample the airfoil system prior to sending to MSET. It is sometimes necessary to check
               this box when a large number of curves is used for an airfoil; this can cause the internal grid
               size limits within MSES to be reached. Downsampling can prevent this error from occurring.
               More details about the downsampling method can be found in the `downsample` method of
               :doc:`../_autosummary/pymead.core.airfoil.Airfoil`.
           * - Max downsampling points
             - The maximum number of points to allow for each airfoil.
           * - Downsampling curvature exponent
             - Values close to 0 place high emphasis on curvature, while values close to â place low emphasis on
               curvature (creating nearly uniform spacing).

MSES
----

MSES is the flow analysis tool in the MSES suite.

MPLOT
-----

MPLOT is the post-processing module in the MSES suite that gives a number of options for exporting data and
generating plots. The *pymead* interface to MPLOT is limited to a small subset of the original features, as
the primary focus is on generating *pymead*-native plots of the flow field and surface data. Of course, MPLOT
can always be used directly from the results in the output folder to generate MSES-native plots.

MPOLAR
------

MPOLAR is the parameter-sweep analysis module in the MSES suite. Currently, the *pymead* interface to MPOLAR is
limited to angle of attack sweeps, which takes advantage of the fact that MSES starts each angle of attack analysis
using the previous angle of attack solution. This means that MPOLAR can run a series of angles of attack much
faster than running MSES individually at each angle of attack.
