Helpful Hints
=============

- When using the Linux version of ``pymead``, you may find that the dialog pop-ups only
  move with the main window. This is the default behavior in some flavors of Linux.
  To change this behavior in Ubuntu 20.04 or newer, run the command shown below in a
  terminal. In other versions of Linux, the key setting to disable is "Attach Modal Dialogs."

.. code-block:: console

   gsettings set org.gnome.mutter attach-modal-dialogs false
