API Tutorials
=============

There are a number of tutorials for the pymead programmatic interface, including examples
on airfoil generation, airfoil analysis, optimization, and plotting data. See
`the GUI section <https://pymead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gui.html>`__ if you are looking for GUI tutorials.

.. note::

   Many of the code blocks in the tutorials concisely teaches various `pymead` concepts by avoiding
   showing the import statements except when the class or function is first used. Therefore, be careful in directly
   copying and pasting any particular code block; some import statements used earlier in the tutorial may be required
   for some of the code to work.
