============================================

Welcome to the documentation page for `pymead`, an object-oriented Python 3 library for
generation, aerodynamic analysis, and aerodynamic shape optimization of parametric
airfoils and airfoil systems.

How to Use Pymead
-----------------

`pymead` has both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and an
Application-Programming Interface (API) written in Python (see the "Architecture"
section for more details). For those less familiar with Python and those mainly seeking
to use the built-in features of `pymead`, the GUI is the main recommended method of use.
For those desiring to extend `pymead`'s functionality
